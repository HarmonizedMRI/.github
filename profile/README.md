# Welcome to the HarmonizedMRI project

The HarmonizedMRI project is dedicated to supporting the development and dissemination of
open, transparent, and vendor-neutral MRI sequences and protocols
based on the [Pulseq](https://pulseq.github.io/) sequence development platform.

**Browse available Pulseq protocols:** You can browse sequences developed by us as well as the broader community
by checking out the various repositories on this site, and the project list at https://harmonizedmri.github.io/.

**Contribute your own Pulseq project:** We invite you to submit your own project using the Google form at https://harmonizedmri.github.io/, 
or join the development team and create a new repository on this site.

**Pulseq user group virtual meeting:** Please join our monthly Pulseq user group virtual meeting, open to anyone interested in Pulseq
[registration here](https://umich.zoom.us/meeting/register/DDHjJS_lTtS9ADGvekSKQw).
